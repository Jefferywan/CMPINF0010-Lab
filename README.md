# CMPINF0010-Lab
Purpose of this repo:
    This is for CPMINF0010 BIG IDEA assignment

Description(What my code does):
    In my repo, there is a file "simpleProgram" which takes a user input, if user want to print the input out, they should type in __"1"__ fot it.
    Otherwise, it will do nothing.

Example:
    {Please give me your name:
    
User input: Alan

   If you want to print it -> type in 1;
    
   If you want do nothing -> type in 2 
    
User input: 1

System output(print): Your name is: Alan 
}


Why I choose this license:
    
    
Why I choose this Code-Of-Conduct:
    __Becuase this Code-Of-Conduct is widely used by many people, I found they probably covered nearly every aspect of what the contributor should do and shouldn't do. I think it is a great idea to just use their CoC to make sure thing go in a right way__
